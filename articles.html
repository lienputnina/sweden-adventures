                            Learning a new language is kind of like climbing a
                            mountain – you start off full of inspiration and
                            determination, doubt yourself in the middle and feel
                            like a hero at the end. In the previous article I
                            talked about my experience at the internship in
                            Sweden and the Swedish society. This article will be
                            about the Swedish language, my journey of climbing
                            Mount Swedish and will include the resources that
                            have helped me to do it.

                                impressions in Sweden. This article will cover
                                my overall experience at the internship and some
                                examples of the social norms here. However, all
                                beginnings are challenging – new premises, new
                                colleagues, new tasks, just to name a few.
                                Excited, amazed, puzzled and intrigued were
                                states and emotions constantly circulating
                                through my nervous system during the first week.

                                        of articles where I share my experiences of living
                                        in Sweden for the period of my ERASMUS Postgraduate
                                        trainee-ship. Here you will find everything from
                                        what it’s like to live here in general (places,
                                        prices etc.) to sightseeing, learning the language
                                        and much more. Come, join me in my journey of
                                        discovering Sverige and I hope you’ll enjoy it as
                                        much as me!
