              Swedish is a North Germanic language. North Germanic languages
              make up one of the three branches of the Germanic languages. They
              are often divided into Continental Scandinavian languages
              (Swedish, Danish and Norwegian) and Insular Nordic languages
              (Faroese, Icelandic, Norn and Greenlandic Norse).
            </p>
            <p>
              Swedish is the official language of Sweden. Safety instructions
              and product information must be available in Swedish. The language
              used in schools should also normally be Swedish. It is spoken by
              almost 10 million people. Around 9 million people are native
              Swedish speakers, of which 8.5 million live in Sweden.
            </p>
            <p>
              Until World War II Swedish was spoken in Estonia and Latvia as
              well. The latter were part of the Swedish Livonia during the
              17th-18th century (Plakans, 2011). Historical ties explain, why
              there are quite a few Latvian words spoken and written almost
              exactly the same as in Swedish. Below are some examples: A pan:
              Swedish – ‘panna’ (also means ‘forehead’), Latvian – panna A
              chimney: Swedish – ‘skorsten’, Latvian – skurstenis A school:
              Swedish – skola, Latvian – skola A screw: Swedish – skruv, Latvian
              – skrūve, etc. There are also funny examples, where the word has a
              completely different meaning, like: Pumpa – ‘a pumpkin’ in
              Swedish, ‘a pimple’ in Latvian. ‘Pumpafro’ means pumpkin seeds.
              Imagine my amusement, walking into a store here on my first week
              in Sweden.

              all beginnings are challenging – new premises, new colleagues, new
              tasks, just to name a few.

            <p class="article-card-paragraph">
              Sweden is famous around the world for lots of things: Saab and
              Volvo automobiles, the music group ABBA, pickled herring and the
              DIY megastore IKEA. It is equally as famous for its stunning
              scenery, picturesque fishing villages, being the land of reindeer
              and endless summer sun.

              where I share my experiences of living in Sweden for the period of
              my ERASMUS Postgraduate trainee-ship. Here you will find
              everything from what it’s like to live here in general (places,
              prices etc.) to sightseeing, learning the language and much more.
